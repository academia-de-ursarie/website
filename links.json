With sleek curves and vibrant screens the Lumia 800 and 710 are head turners. But could Lumia's Spanish translation mean something else that might be a head turner? Apparently, the term Lumia is the colloquial term for prostitute in Spanish. Much like \"call girl\" and \"working girl\" are colloquial terms in English. Lumia isn't the only product name that may get lost in translation here lately. Remember Siri?  The personal assistant Apple introduced with the iPhone 4S? It turns out the Japanese translation for Siri means \"ass\" or \"buttocks\". The Nokia Lumia Windows Phones are impressive but does it matter that some Spanish customers may get a chuckle about having a \"prostitute\" in their pants pocket? It's gotta be better than iPhone users who speak to their \"buttocks\" for assistance.

THE WORLDS UNSOLD CAR STOCKPILE Houston...We have a problem!...Nobody is buying brand new cars anymore!  Well they are, but not on the scale they once were.  Millions of brand new unsold cars are just sitting redundant on runways and car parks around the world.  There, they stay, slowly deteriorating without being maintained. Below is an image of a massive car park at Swindon, United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of unsold cars just sitting there with not a buyer in sight. The car manufacturers have to buy more and more land just to park their cars as they perpetually roll off the production line. There is proof that the worlds recession is still biting and wont let go.  All around the world there are huge stockpiles of unsold cars and they are being added to every day.  They have run out of space to park all of these brand new unsold cars and are having to buy acres and acres of land to store them."},{"url":"http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-create-totally-secure-cookies","title":"How to Create Totally Secure Cookies - Treehouse Blog","desc":""},{"url":"http://m.hugelol.com/lol/279230","title":"HUGELOL - The funniest place in the Universe.","desc":"HUGELOL is the funniest place in the Universe."},{"url":"http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/2014/05/female-masturbation-app-is-rejected-from-the-app-store","title":"Female Masturbation App Is Rejected From The App Store | Real Life | The Debrief","desc":"Don't expect to see your 'Friendly Neighbourhood Vulva' on an iPhone any time soon."},{"url":"http://menshumor.tinybytes.me/europe-vs-usa-know-the-difference","title":"Europe Vs.
