Welcome to __Academia de Ursărie__, also known as "Qui est le plus ursar? 101 Heckari pe peronul Academiei de Ursărie cu Nea Doge și șefu' păpădiilor la biro'".

Simply put, this resource contains the archive of links, especially related to __IT__ field and __Software Development__, with dedication towards __JavaScript__.

The links are not classified, organized nor labeled. At least not for the first release. Ursars still need to acquire some data mining skills.

We did our best to keep only the relevant content for you, but NSFW material might still be present. 

__Use this resource at your own risk and please don't disturb us if you potentially damage yourself.__
